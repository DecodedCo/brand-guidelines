# Writing: Voice and Tone

One way we write empowering content is by being aware of our voice and our tone. This section explains the difference between voice and tone, and lays out the elements of each as they apply to Decoded

What’s the difference between voice and tone? Think of it this way: you have the same voice all the time, but your tone changes. You might use one tone when you're out to dinner with your closest friends, and a different tone when you're in a meeting with your boss.

Your tone also changes depending on the emotional state of the person you’re addressing. You wouldn’t want to use the same tone of voice with someone who’s scared or upset as you would with someone who’s laughing.

The same is true for Decoded. Our voice doesn’t change much from day to day, but our tone changes all the time.

## Voice

Decoded's voice is human. It’s familiar, friendly, and straightforward. We want to educate people without patronising or confusing them.

One way to think of our voice is to compare what it is to what it isn’t. Decoded's voice is:

* Expert but not bossy
* Informal but not sloppy
* Confident but not cocky
* Smart but not stodgy
* Fun but not silly
* Helpful but not overbearing

## Tone

Decoded's tone is usually informal, but it’s always more important to be clear than entertaining. When you’re writing, consider the reader’s state of mind. Are they relieved X Y Z? Once you have an idea of their emotional state, you can adjust your tone accordingly.
