# Templates

All new brand templates are shared on the [Decoded Templates Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0AE96BBcjg4gvUk9PVA). 

New templates are added as they are being designed.

All templates are read-only. Open the template and select `File -> Make a copy...` to edit it. Then select `File -> Move to Folder...` to store it in an appropriate location on the drive.
