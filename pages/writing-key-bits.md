# Writing: the Key Bits

This style guide goes into depth on many subjects. It may be more information than you need. Here are the most important things to know.

## Principles

Good content is:

- Clear
- Useful
- Friendly
- Appropriate

## Voice and tone

Decoded's voice is:

* Human
* Familiar
* Friendly
* Straightforward

Our tone changes depending on the situation, but it's generally informal. We have a sense of humour, but we value clarity over entertainment.

Our priorities are to inform or educate readers without patronising or confusing them.

## Writing about people

We write with a person-first perspective. Being aware of the impact of your language will help make Decoded a better place to work and a better business to work with.

- Avoid gendered language and use the singular “they.”
- Don’t reference age or disability unless it’s relevant to what you’re writing.
- When writing about a person, use their preferred pronouns; if you don’t know those, just use their name.

## Grammar and mechanics

- Some people will read every word you write. Others will just scan. Help everyone by grouping related ideas together and using descriptive headers and subheaders.
- Focus your message, and create a hierarchy of information. Lead with the main point or the most important content.
- Use active voice and positive language.
- Use short words and sentences.
- Avoid unnecessary modifiers.
- Use specific examples.
- Avoid vague language.
- Be consistent. Adhere to the copy patterns and style points outlined in this guide.
- Feel free to use contractions.
- Use the Oxford comma. Otherwise, use common sense.
- Don’t use underline, and don’t use any combination of italic, bold, caps, and underline.
- When in doubt, read your writing out loud.
