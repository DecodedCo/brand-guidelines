# Writing: About People

We write the same way we build content: with a person-first perspective. Whether you’re writing for an internal or external audience, it's important to write for and about other people in a way that’s compassionate, inclusive, and respectful. Being aware of the impact of your language will help make Decoded a better place to work, and a better business to work with. In this section we'll lay out some guidelines for writing about people with compassion, and share some resources for further learning.

### Age

Don’t reference a person’s age unless it’s relevant to what you’re writing. If it *is* relevant, include the person’s specific age, offset by commas.

- The CEO, 16, just got her driver’s license.

Don’t refer to people using age-related descriptors like “young,” “old,” or “elderly.”

### Disability

Don’t refer to a person’s disability unless it’s relevant to what you’re writing. If you need to mention it, use language that emphasises the person first: ”she has a disability” rather than “she is disabled.”

When writing about a person with disabilities, don’t use the words “suffer,” “victim,” or “handicapped.”

### Gender and sexuality

Don’t call groups of people “guys.” Don’t call women “girls.”

Avoid gendered terms in favour of neutral alternatives, like “businessperson” instead of “businessman.”

It’s OK to use “they” as a singular pronoun.

When writing about a person, use their communicated pronouns. When in doubt, just ask or use their name.

### Hearing

Use “deaf” as an adjective to describe a person with significant hearing loss. You can also use “partially deaf” or “hard of hearing.”

### Medical conditions

Don’t refer to a person’s medical condition unless it’s relevant to what you’re writing.

If a reference to a person’s medical condition is warranted, use the same rules as writing about people with physical disabilities and emphasise the person first. Don’t call a person with a medical condition a “victim.”

### Mental and cognitive conditions

Don’t refer to a person’s mental or cognitive condition unless it’s relevant to what you’re writing. Never assume that someone has a medical, mental, or cognitive condition.

Don’t describe a person as “mentally ill.” If a reference to a person’s mental or cognitive condition is warranted, use the same rules as writing about people with physical disabilities or medical conditions and emphasise the person first.

### Vision

Use the adjective “blind” to describe a person who is unable to see. Use “low vision” to describe a person with limited vision.
