# Logo

The Decoded logotype is our most visible and important brand asset. Learn how to best represent the logotype and Decoded brand in any experience.  
Where possible we use the round, yellow logo. In small sizes and on full yellow backgrounds, the logotype can be used without the yellow background.

</div>

# Sizing

To preserve legibility, the logotype should never be printed smaller than 30mm for print and 120px for screen.   

# Partner Logos

Most logos look pretty bad on yellow, keep it simple and use a white background.

<div class="example">

</div>

To keep both logos balanced, draw a square around the Decoded logo and use that as the maximum size of the partner logo.
