# Using the Decoded CC Library

We created a collection of styles, colors and elements to use in InDesign and other Adobe Creative Cloud Apps.

## Setting up the Library
You'll have to have Adobe Creative Cloud and InDesign installed on your Mac. If you have your own Adobe login, follow steps 1 to 3 to add the Decoded library to your account.
If you're working on a one-off document on the info@decoded.com account, the library is alrady added to your account and you can skip directly to step 4.

1. To get started, head to the Adobe Website to add the [Decoded Library](http://adobe.ly/1Lst3EU).
2. Click on `Save to Creative Cloud` in the top right corner.
